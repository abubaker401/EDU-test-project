## Project Title

**NFT Collection Tracker**

## Project Description

The "NFT Collection Tracker" is a platform built to facilitate the buying, selling, and auctioning of digital art as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The platform allows users to mint unique NFTs, list them for sale, and auction them with a decentralized system. By integrating blockchain technology, users can prove ownership of digital assets, enhancing trust in the value and provenance of digital art.

## Project Vision

The vision behind the NFT Collection Tracker is to create a transparent, easy-to-use platform where digital artists, collectors, and enthusiasts can engage in the buying, selling, and auctioning of digital art securely. The goal is to bring more people into the NFT ecosystem while maintaining an intuitive user experience, secure transactions, and a vibrant marketplace for digital creativity.

## Future Scope

1. **Enhanced Auction Mechanism**: Future versions of the platform will implement a dynamic bidding system with features like reserve prices and automatic bidding.
   
2. **Royalties System**: Implement a royalty mechanism where creators earn a percentage of sales each time their NFT changes hands.

3. **Marketplace Expansion**: The platform could integrate with other marketplaces or support cross-chain interactions, expanding its reach to a global audience.

4. **User Profiles & Social Integration**: Users will be able to create profiles showcasing their owned or created NFTs and interact with other users via social features.

## Key Features

- **Minting NFTs**: Users can create unique digital assets (NFTs) by minting them onto the blockchain.
  
- **Buying NFTs**: Buyers can purchase NFTs at a fixed price set by the seller.

- **Auction System**: A fully functional auction system where users can list their NFTs, set a starting price, and run timed auctions.

- **Secure Transactions**: All transactions occur on the blockchain, ensuring security, transparency, and immutability.

- **Ownership Transfer**: When an NFT is bought or auctioned, ownership is securely transferred to the buyer, with funds being sent to the seller.

- **Event Emission**: The contract emits events for key actions like minting, auction creation, auction end, and transfers, making it easy to track NFT activity.
